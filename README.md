#SSW: A Python Wrapper for the SIMD Smith-Waterman

## Overview

[SSW][ssw_repo] is a fast implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which
uses the Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions to parallelize
the algorithm at the CPU level.  This repository wraps the SSW library into an
easy to install, high-level python interface with no external library dependancies.

The SSW library is written by Mengyao Zhao and Wan-Ping Lee, and this python
interface is maintained by Giles Hall.
